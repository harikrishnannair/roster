# roster
Hi. I am trying to automate my team's roster and learn code this way. 
So, I am very new here and looking to learn Python. 
My project is this: A program that allows users to input data -- team members, their name, leaves required, which are their days off -- and get an output that has the duty chart.
I have done some partial code. But, stuck. Hit me up if you are interested in helping out.
